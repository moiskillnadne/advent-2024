Welcome to my repository dedicated to **Advent of Code 2024** ‚Äî an annual Christmas-themed coding marathon that challenges developers worldwide!

## üìñ About the Project
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a series of 25 programming challenges, one for each day in December leading up to Christmas. These challenges cover a wide range of topics, from algorithms and data structures to creative problem-solving.

In this repository, I share my solutions for Advent of Code 2024 challenges. You will find:
- My solutions written in JavaScript.
- Translations of task descriptions and stories into **English** and **Russian**.
- Input data for each challenge.
- Correct answers for verification.

## üöÄ Repository Structure
Each day is organized into its own directory with the following structure:

```
day-1/
  CORRECT-ANSWERS.md  # Correct answers for verification
  input/              # Input data for the challenge
  part-1.js           # Solution for part 1
  part-2.js           # Solution for part 2
  STORY-EN.md         # Task description and story in English
  STORY-RU.md         # Task description and story in Russian
```

## üåü Goals
This project has several goals:
1. **Practice Algorithms and Data Structures**: Advent of Code offers unique challenges that deepen your knowledge of algorithms.
2. **Document the Process**: Translating stories and task descriptions into English and Russian helps understand the context of each challenge.
3. **Inspire and Share**: Sharing my solutions to inspire other developers and showcase different approaches to solving these challenges.

## üñãÔ∏è Advent of Code Stories
Each challenge comes with a story that sets the atmosphere and context. I translate these stories into **English** and **Russian** and save them in `STORY-EN.md` and `STORY-RU.md` files, respectively.
